# Glaucoma Detection

#### Glaucoma detection is a simple android application to detect the glaucoma disease.

## Description
The application basically takes a single fundus image either through gallery or directly through camera and predicts the output. This system is built using the CNN algorithm. The user first has to login/signup to the application. Then he/she can upload the fundus image, which is then processed by the developed cnn algorithm and the output is predicted
